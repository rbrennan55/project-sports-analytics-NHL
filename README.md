# project-sports-analytics-NHL


This project contains statistical information regarding the Stanley Cup winning teams and the corresponding losing teams from 1991-1992 to the 2021-2022 season. The purpose of this project is to analyze the age and nationality distributions of players on these teams and examine any significant differences between the winners and losers and if there are any statistical significant difference between the team.

Note: The 2004-2005 season was player work stopage and therefore NHL suspended the season.  Only 29 Stanley Cup seasons were analysed
